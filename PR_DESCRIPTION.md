# Pull Request: Integrate Theories Component and Resolve Merge Conflicts

## Summary

This pull request includes the following changes:
- Integrated the `Theories` component into the main application.
- Ensured that the `/api/theories` endpoint is correctly set up and the backend server is running.
- Added routing using `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between different components.
- Resolved merge conflicts in several files, including `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `public/index.html`, `public/manifest.json`, `src/App.js`, `src/index.css`, and `src/index.js`.
- Removed duplicate imports and unnecessary content from the `src/App.js` file.
- Verified that the Chakra UI and React Router setup works as expected.

- Added a loading state and basic styling to the `Theories.js` component.
- Integrated the `Theories` component into the `App.js` file and defined routes for different components.
- Set up the backend server using `express`, `body-parser`, `cors`, `pg`, and `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`.
